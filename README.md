# Project-Based Learning (PBL) — One Shots

This repository documents my **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** journey.  
It contains **one-shot implementations** of the skills and concepts I explore — primarily focused on **full-stack development and cloud technologies**.

---

## 📌 Focus Areas
- **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- **DevOps Tools**: Docker

---

## 📂 Structure
Each folder represents a **learning unit** or **topic**:
- `MERN/` → MERN stack implementations  
- `Docker/` → Docker experiments  



This structure helps keep concepts modular and organized.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn by **building small, focused implementations** ("one-shots").  
- Develop **practical skills** in full-stack 
- Build a **personal reference library** for future projects and internships.

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder of interest (e.g., `Docker/Container-Basics`).  
2. Explore the code, notes, or experiments.  
3. Run and tweak the implementations for practice.

---

## 📝 Note
This repository is **not a single project** but a **living archive** of my continuous learning.  
Expect incremental additions and experiments as I progress.

---

✨ Stay tuned as this repo grows with **MERN amd Docker one shots**!
